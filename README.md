# PZPowerPlantsMod
The spawning function works! the client and server scripts are communicating properly. Now i need to add a couple more functions to stop the generators: i'm thinking its better to have 2 stop functions. One that only drains all fuel in every generator managed by this power meter(checked every ten minutes in-game and can also be triggered by a "disconnect" command which will be in a secondary context menu option for the power meter object. This option would only appear if the power meter is connected and the power plant is on (The power plant isn't ready and there is no way to "turn it on" yet, but we can just set this to true for now)). Another function will delete all generators managed by this power meter(triggered by a player picking up the power meter).
